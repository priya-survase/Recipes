    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shankarpali is a lightly sweet Maharashtrian snack that is basically deep-fried crispy biscuits. Make this crispy crunchy snack for your tea time or for festivals like Holi, Diwali, etc using my no-fail recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All-Purpose Flour (Maida) – It makes the base of shankarpali. Use good quality organic maida for the best result.For a healthy alternative, you can use half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>Fine Semolina (Barik Sooji) – A little semolina makes it very crispy. Make sure to use fine semolina and not coarse.</li>
        <li>Powdered Sugar – Powder the regular granulated sugar in a blender and use it in the recipe. DO NOT use confectioner’s sugar which is also sometimes called powdered sugar. It has cornstarch added to it which might change the texture of shankarpali.</li>
        <li>Others – You will also need ghee, milk, and oil or ghee for frying.Add in a little cardamom powder for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make</h2>
    <h3>Make the dough</h3>
        <p>Mix 2 cups of all-purpose flour (maida) and 2 tablespoon fine semolina (barik sooji ) in a large bowl or parat (a large shallow Indian plate).
            All purpose flour and fine semolina mixed in large shallow plate.
            
            Heat 2 tablespoon ghee in a small pan over high heat until very hot.

            Pour the hot ghee over the flour and mix with a spoon. This is called giving Moyan and it makes the shankarpali crispy and flaky.
            
            Tip – You can replace ghee with oil too but the taste and texture of shankarpali will differ.

            Once the mixture is cooled slightly, mix well using your fingers.
            
            Add ¾ cup powdered sugar and mix well.

            Add milk (approx ½ cup), little by little, and knead to make a slightly tight dough.

    <h3>Shape the dough</h3>

            Knead the dough once again for 20-30 seconds and divide it into 2 parts.

            Roll one part to make a ¼ inch thick circle. Keep the other part covered with the cloth.

            Cut the circle into 1-inch squares using a knife. Discard the uneven ends and add the dough to the remaining part of the dough.

    <h3>Fry the Shankarpali</h3>
        <p>
            Heat oil or ghee for frying in a pan over medium heat.

            Once the ghee is hot, reduce the heat to medium-low.

            Tip – To check if the ghee is perfectly heated, drop a small ball of dough into the hot ghee. If it rises in 5-8 seconds, then ghee is at the right temperature. If it rises soon, then let the ghee cool down a bit and if it is taking time to rise, then heat it some more.

            Add the squares in hot ghee and fry on medium-low heat until nicely browned. Keep stirring frequently while frying to ensure even browning. It will take 12-15 minutes for each batch to fry.

            Note – Keep in mind that shankarpali will continue to brown from the residual heat, so do not over fry them.

            Drain on a plate lined with a paper towel. Shankarpali will not be crispy at this stage. They will crisp up once cooled.

            Repeat the process with the other part of the dough as well. Make sure to check the temperature of the ghee before a

            dding the next batch.

            Cool the shankarpalli completely and store in an air-tight container for up to 15 days.
